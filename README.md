# Psych-Final-Project

This study takes inspiration from the coloful dot study presented in this course. It uses this idea, modifies how the stimuli are presented to fit new paradigm, adds a manipulationm, and records moderating varibles. 



1. STUDY OVERVIEW:

This study looks at how reaction time to identify dot colour changes based on the the emotional valence of facial stimuli presented before that dot.

This is a 3 (happy face, sad face, neutral face) by 2 (red dot, blue dot) factorial within subjects desing. 



2. METHOD:

First particiapants answer some demographic questions that include, age, handedness, and stress level. Then the study is explained to the 

participant. 

Next, 2 block of 10 trials are presented. Each trial consists of a fixation cross for 500ms, then a randomly valenced face (happy, sad, or neutral) 

for 1000ms, then a fixation cross for 250ms, then a red or blue dot that they must identify as red or blue using the keybaord. Once the participant 

has completed all trials, the study ends. 



3. DATA OUTPUT:

The data that is recorded here is block number, trial number, dot colour, if their response was correct or incorrect, reaction time, face stimuli 

valence, age, handedness, and stress level. This is output into the final data frame, which then gets saved to a data file folder.
